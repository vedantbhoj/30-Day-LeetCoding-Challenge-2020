# 30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge-2020
With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, this is the perfect opportunity to focus on studying up for future code interviews. In order to help stay focused, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April. A problem will appear at midnight PDT each day, and we have 24 hours to solve it and submit it.<br>
